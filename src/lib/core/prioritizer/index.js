/**
 * Level-Driven Prioritizer - Modular Architecture
 *
 * This module provides backwards-compatible exports while supporting
 * the new modular architecture.
 *
 * Status: Phase 2 Complete (70%)
 * - âœ… Constants extracted to constants.js (122 lines)
 * - âœ… Utils extracted to utils.js (146 lines)
 * - âœ… CurriculumProcessor extracted to CurriculumProcessor.js (225 lines)
 * - âœ… ProgressAssessor extracted to ProgressAssessor.js (312 lines)
 * - âœ… PriorityCalculator extracted to PriorityCalculator.js (350 lines)
 * - ðŸš§ Main class still in ../levelDrivenPrioritizer.js (Phase 3 pending)
 *
 * Total extracted: ~1,155 lines (67% of original 1,712 lines)
 *
 * Next steps (Phase 3):
 * - Extract TenseSelector logic (~200 lines)
 * - Extract RecommendationEngine logic (~150 lines)
 * - Create new LevelDrivenPrioritizer orchestrator (~200 lines)
 * - Update 10 dependent files
 * - Delete old file
