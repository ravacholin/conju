/**
 * Level-Driven Prioritizer - Modular Architecture
 *
 * This module provides backwards-compatible exports while supporting
 * the new modular architecture.
 *
 * Status: Phase 1 Complete
 * - âœ… Constants extracted to constants.js
 * - âœ… Utils extracted to utils.js
 * - âœ… CurriculumProcessor extracted to CurriculumProcessor.js
 * - ðŸš§ Main class still in ../levelDrivenPrioritizer.js (Phase 2 pending)
 *
 * Next steps:
 * - Extract ProgressAssessor logic (~300 lines)
 * - Extract TenseSelector logic (~400 lines)
 * - Extract PriorityCalculator logic (~300 lines)
 * - Move main class here
 * - Delete old file
